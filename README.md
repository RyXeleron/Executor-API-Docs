## What is Synapse X?

**Synapse X** is a proprietary Lua script execution utility developed by [Synapse Softworks LLC](https://github.com/synllc) tailored for ambitious developers and aspiring hobbyists alike. It can be used to debug games, analyze script behavior, conduct penetration testing or simply toy around with the Lua programming language and the extensions we offer. Maintained since 2016, Synapse X has a track record of great stability and resilience to change, and will continue to offer these advantages for the years to come.

It can be purchased for **$15**-**$20** over at the [official website](https://x.synapse.to). This repository contains some open source assets related to Synapse X, such as website files or documentation. For the interested, **an open source version of the October 21, 2019 build of Synapse X** can be accessed over at this [repository](https://github.com/synllc/SynapseX).
